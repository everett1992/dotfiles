# Filename Cleanup 3: Filenames of feeds hosted by LBC Plus corrupted.
# Fixed per MoonUnit's feature request (#1660764)
#
# Takes an URL that looks like:  http://lbc.audioagain.com/shared/audio/stream.mp3?guid=2007-03/14<...snip>
#                            <snip...>a7766e8ad2748269fd347eaee2b2e3f8&amp;source=podcast.php&amp;channel_id=88
#
# Which normally creates a file named: a7766e8ad2748269fd347eaee2b2e3f8&amp;source=podcast.php&amp;channel_id=88

# This fix extracts the date of the episode and changes the filename to 2007-03-14.mp3

# Downloaded filenames look like: 1189153569775.mp3?programa=El+mat%ED+de+Catalunya+R%E0dio&amp;podcast=y
